# Language-Identifier-NLP

This NLP project is created to indentify multiple languages given as text input.
The model is trained on a dataset of languages with sentences of each language.
We make use of logistic regression model to predict the language.

The dataset is a small language detection dataset. This dataset consists of text details for 17 different languages, ie, you will be able to create an NLP model for predicting 17 different language.

The accuracy of the model is around 98% which is pretty good considering the model cannot handle multiple languages in one sentence.
